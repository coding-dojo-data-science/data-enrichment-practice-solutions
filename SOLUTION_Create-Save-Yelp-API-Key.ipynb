    "- Since our API-Keys are attached to our individual accounts and we are allotted a maximum number of API calls per day/month, it is very important not to publicly display our API credentials publicly, especially in our project repositories.\n",
    "- To prevent this, we are going to be creating a new hidden folder in your User folder called `.secret/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal/gitbash and navigate to your user folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~ \n",
    "# or\n",
    "cd /Users/your-username/\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. Type `pwd` to confirm you are in the right folder.\n",
